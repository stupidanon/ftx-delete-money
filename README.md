# ftx-delete
Tries to delete all of your ftx account's money! CAREFUL!
This app uses python3 and pip. Tested on mac, and my own ftx account 
Once you have emptied your money with this, you can go to (FTX Giving page)[https://ftx.com/giving] and empty the rest, straight to 0.
This is so if you only have some dust and do not wish to be doxxed like in celsius, maybe the bankruptcy procedures will ignore you since you have a balance of $0.

- clone repo with git if familiar
```
git clone https://github.com/stupidanon/ftx-delete-money.git
```
- if not

    - click download zip
    - export the zip file to a folder you made


**Instructions:**
1. install with `pip`
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. run the python file
```
python fucksbf.py
```

3. make sure to have your ftx **api and secret** keys on hand
